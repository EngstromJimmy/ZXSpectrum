# ZXSpectrum
When I was 7 years old I got my first computer.  
A ZX Spectrum.  

I still remember, the first thing I did after booting it was not to play games.  
I sat down and wrote my first app.  

10 PRINT "Jimmy"  
20 GOTO 10 

This was the moment I decided that I wanted to become a developer.
