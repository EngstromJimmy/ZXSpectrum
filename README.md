## Background

When I was 7 years old I got my first computer, a ZX Spectrum.  
I remember that I sat down, booted it up, and wrote:

10 PRINT "Jimmy"  
20 GOTO 10

This was MY code!, I made the computer do things. 
That was the moment I decided I wanted to become a developer.
You can find it here on Github (Firstapp.z80).

After becoming a developer I wanted to see if I could make an emulator written in C#. This has become my test project, the thing I try out all new technologies with.
If you ever see me present, chances are that I will mention the ZX Spectrum.

The naming of the project might seem strange, I originally developed the emulator for Xbox so ZXBox made sense at the time.  
I have chosen to keep the name think of is as a ZX(Spectrum) in an other box =).

I did a talk about Blazor at Microsoft Ignite 2019 where I demoed my ZX Spectrum emulator running on Blazor WebAssembly. After doing a talk on Blazor and Blutooth at Live Coders Conf, I got a lot of comments on my ZX Spectrum so I decided to publish it =)  
You can find the Blazor implementation here http://zxbox.com .  
I got a lot of amazing feedback and many wanted to see the code so I decided to share that as well.

There are still things left to do for example implementing sound (for Blazor) and support for more file formats.

It supports SNA and Z80-formats and you can connect an XBox gamepad to emulate Kempston Joystick.
